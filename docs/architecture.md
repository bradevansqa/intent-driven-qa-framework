# Architecture Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture of the intent-driven QA framework.

The system is intentionally divided into three layers:
- Intent (manual tests)
- Decision (QA agent + memory)
- Execution (Playwright automation)

Detailed implementation lives in layer-specific documentation.
